# zero-to-llm

Welcome to **zero-to-llm**, a machine learning and LLM (Large Language Model) study repository created as part of the *Hanghae Plus AI* program.

This repository contains notebooks covering deep learning theory, LLM internals, hands-on usage of popular LLM libraries, and cloud-based deployment & fine-tuning.  
All experiments are run on **Windows**, using **PyCharm** with **Jupyter Notebook**, accelerated by an **NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti GPU**.
